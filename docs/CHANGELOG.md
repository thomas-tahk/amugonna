## Current Status
- **Phase**: Database foundation complete - ready for feature development
- **Next Priority**: User authentication system implementation
- **Focus Areas**: 
  - JWT-based user registration and login
  - Basic ingredient input interface
  - Simple recipe matching algorithm implementation

## Key Decisions Made
- **Data Source**: Spoonacular API for initial recipe data
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data and complex queries
- **Algorithm**: Start simple, evolve to sophisticated scoring
- **Priority**: Strong focus on dietary restrictions and allergy safety

## Development Notes
- Monorepo allows independent development of frontend and backend
- Strong TypeScript usage for type safety across the stack
- Documentation-first approach to maintain clarity and direction
- Prioritizing user safety in dietary restriction handling
