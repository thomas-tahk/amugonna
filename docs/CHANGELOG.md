# Development Changelog

## Project Initialization
- Created monorepo structure with React frontend and Node.js backend
- Set up TypeScript configuration for both client and server
- Added basic Express server with health check endpoints
- Configured Vite for React development
- Initial commit and remote repository setup

## Documentation Setup
- Created comprehensive documentation structure
- Added CLAUDE.md for development context and instructions
- Created ROADMAP.md with development phases and priorities
- Added RESEARCH.md for technical decisions and API research
- Designed ARCHITECTURE.md with database schema and system design
- Created API_DESIGN.md with detailed endpoint specifications
- Established CHANGELOG.md for tracking development progress

## Database Configuration & Security
- Switched from Prisma dev database to local PostgreSQL installation
- Updated connection string for standard PostgreSQL setup
- Created detailed setup instructions for local development
- Added testing/verification preferences to project documentation
- Established .env file security policies in project documentation
- Created comprehensive .env.example template with variable descriptions
- Defined policy: No direct .env modifications without human approval

## Database Setup Complete
- Successfully installed PostgreSQL@15 locally with Homebrew
- Created `amugonna_dev` database with proper user permissions
- Applied Prisma schema to database - all tables created successfully
- Verified server-database connection via health endpoint
- Database foundation fully operational and tested

## Frontend Foundation Scaffold
- Built comprehensive React component architecture
- Created TypeScript types and API service functions
- Implemented authentication context with React hooks
- Built ingredient search and pantry management components
- Added complete styling and responsive design
- **Note**: Large token consumption led to strategy shift

## Development Strategy Evolution
- **Challenge**: High token usage for comprehensive code generation
- **Solution**: Switching to guided development approach
- **Benefit**: Better token efficiency and user code ownership
- **Next**: Test backend APIs before frontend integration

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Backend complete, frontend scaffold ready for testing
- **Next Priority**: Backend API testing and validation
- **Focus Areas**: 
  - Database seeding and API endpoint testing
  - Guided frontend development approach
  - Incremental feature building with user-led implementation

## Key Decisions Made
- **Data Source**: Spoonacular API for initial recipe data
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data and complex queries
- **Algorithm**: Start simple, evolve to sophisticated scoring
- **Priority**: Strong focus on dietary restrictions and allergy safety

## Development Notes
- Monorepo allows independent development of frontend and backend
- Strong TypeScript usage for type safety across the stack
- Documentation-first approach to maintain clarity and direction
- Prioritizing user safety in dietary restriction handling
