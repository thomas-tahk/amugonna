- [ ] Offline functionality
- [ ] Mobile optimization

## Phase 6: Polish & Deployment
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security audit

## Current Priority Focus
1. **Database setup** - PostgreSQL schema for users, recipes, ingredients
2. **Basic ingredient input** - Clean, fast interface for ingredient entry
3. **Simple recipe matching** - Initial algorithm to match recipes with available ingredients
4. **Dietary restriction system** - Core feature for allergies and intolerances

## Key Design Decisions
- **Data source**: Start with free API (Spoonacular recommended), add user content later
- **Matching algorithm**: Sophisticated scoring prioritizing dietary safety and ingredient availability
- **User experience**: Fast, convenient ingredient input with strong dietary accommodation
